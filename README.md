Clomp is an E-Commerce platform built on top of Clomp's Administrator Dashboard ([ClompAd](https://github.com/lorenzopasqualini/clompAd)), in which products can be sold to the end-user on the main storefront; all of this is through the store owner handling the dashboard behind the scenes, which has its own interface.

## Storefront

Stripe is integrated as form of payment, shipping and order confirmation. No user sign-in is needed to purchase on the storefront, while Clerk is used in the dashboard to verify store owner admin authentication. The modal, cart and product description are picked up from ShadCN/UI components. Styling is handled entirely by TailwindCSS.

A number of features have been implemented to categorize and filter products, smoothening the **user experience** for both the buyer/seller and thus simplifying the **customer's checkout journey**.
